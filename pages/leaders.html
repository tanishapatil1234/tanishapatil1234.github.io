          <h2>Native Poppy by Natalie Gill</h2>
          <p>California-born and raised, Natalie is Native Poppys leader of all things floral design. She launched her intrepid flower business in 2015, to bring beauty to lifes important moments, and to make others happy. 
            With a deep love of the natural world, Natalie has grown her business into a celebration of all the beauty that nature has to offer. Her obsession with Japanese anemones, King Protea, Hellebore, her moms home-grown roses, and tree peonies is rivaled only by her love of eating plate after plate after plate of sushiâ€¦ like seriously, she might be part grizzly bear.
            Natalies goal as a business owner is to create art that is authentic, ambitious, and true to her artistic point of view, and to become more balanced in how she lives day to day, taking time away from work to appreciate friendships, and kick back with her husband Steven and their puppy, Cheddar. She hopes to encourage her team to step into their creative potential and share their talents with the world.
